# Code Style Guidelines

This project follows these conventions:

- Keep code PEP 8 compliant. Use `black` formatting with default settings.
- Type annotations are required for all public functions and classes.
- Do not use monkey patching. Any changes to third party libraries must be done via subclassing or wrapper functions instead of modifying objects at runtime.

These rules apply to all code contributions.
